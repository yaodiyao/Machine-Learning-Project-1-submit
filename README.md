## Project Description

The first course project for EPFL machine learning course. The Higgs boson is discovered
at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN through the observation and analysis of the “decay 
signature” generated by proton collision.  The repaid decay of Higgs boson and the by-product
 of the crash makes it hard to decide whether the given event’s signature is from Higgs boson. 
 This project aims at developing a machine learning method to distinguish Higgs boson and 
 background through the event’s signature.

## Instruction
### Requirement
- python version: 3.7 or above
- required package: numpy

### How to use it 
- execute `run.py` 
- the submission will be generated in folder `data`

## Folders and Files
- `src`: contains python code developed for the project
- `report.pdf`: report describes our method developing process
- `data`: contains original and generated dataset
- `run.py`: executable script to generate estimation

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- `Data Regrouping`: use 'PRI_jet_num' feauture divide data into three groups 
- `Group-based Null Feature Processing`: delete features with constant value
- `Outlier Processing`: detect and replace outliers in initial data
- `Standardization of initial values`: standardize initial data

### Feature Scaling
The raw features and linear regression are too simple to get high precision, so some extra features are added:
- `Bias`: constant 1
- `DER_mass_MMC null value record`: record null value situation in DER_mass_MMC
- `Polynomial (argument)`: polynomial family of original features
- `Sine and cosine`: sine and cosine of original features
- `Exponent and logarithm`: Exponent of original features and logarithm of absolute of original features
- `Cross multiply`: multiplication of each two original features

### Cross Validation
- As the ridge regression is chosen, two hyper parameters, i.e. degree, lambda are tested by cross validation. 
- Considering the performance and accuracy, degree = 5 is chosen
- Based on the analysis of lambda with degree =5, lambdas = [5e-7, 1e-3, 1.8e-3] are chosen for three splited datasets with PRI_jte_num = 0, 1, 2 or 3.
